    <strong>SPECIALIZATION IN ENERGY ENGINEERING</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    The programme imparts knowledge in the field of energy engineering and
    application of Non-Renewable and Renewable energy sources. It also gives
    hands-on experience through practical and project programmes. It is a broad
    field of engineering dealing with energy efficiency, energy services,
    environmental compliance and alternative energy technologies. The programme
    provides the graduates with the knowledge base of how to use energy in the
    most environmental friendly and efficient way. The programme also provides
    insights in solving problems in the storage, distribution, and utilization
    of energy using techniques such as analysis, design, and case studies.
