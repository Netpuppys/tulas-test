    <strong>About the Program</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    The department started since inception of the institute i.e. 2006, with a
    vision to become a leading Centre of Excellence for Education, and Research.
    Since then, it has been widely recognized for its excellent research and
    teaching capabilities. We offer Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) degree
    program in Electronics and Communication Engineering.
    <br />
    <br />
    This department has established itself as an efficient, self-reliant and
    quality conscious entity with the sole aim of producing the most energetic,
    enthusiastic and professionally competent Electronics and Communication
    Engineers with ability to take up the challenges of the field.
    <br />
    <br />
    Electronics and Communication engineering deals with the electronic devices,
    circuits, communication equipments like transmitter and receiver, integrated
    circuits (IC) like microprocessors and microcontrollers etc. It also deals
    with analog and digital communication of the information like audio and
    video, satellite communication, microwave engineering, antenna and wave
    propagation. It also deals with the latest communication protocols like 5G,
    6G, and Voice over internet protocol (VoIP) as well as the latest technology
    like, Internet of things (IoT), Robotics etc. It aims to deepen the
    knowledge and skill of the students on the basic concepts and theories that
    will equip them in their professional work involving analysis, systems
    implementation, operation, production, and maintenance of the various
    applications in the field of Electronics and Communications Engineering. It
    now encompasses more areas than before, being thus a modern and important
    profession for the industrial sector, the scientific fields and for
    technological development.

    <strong>SPECIALIZATION IN INTERNET OF THINGS (IoT)</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    This Specialization covers the study of Internet of Things (IoT) products
    and services—including devices for sensing, actuation, processing, and
    communication to help students develop skills and experiences in designing
    novel systems. The Specialization has theory and lab sections. In the lab
    sections you will learn hands-on IoT concepts such as sensing, actuation and
    communication.
    <br />
    <br />
    The specialization will give the theoretical and practical learning of
    internet and communication protocols. This will help the students to develop
    heterogeneous applications in the field of the internet of things (IoT). The
    program includes the knowledge of various terminologies and protocols of
    IoT, WSN and machine to machine communication.
