    Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science & Engineering (B.Tech. CSE) is
    one of the most sought-after engineering degrees. The program teaches
    students about computer applications and systems in order to prepare them
    for a career in the IT industry. In this program, students learn about
    programming languages, digital and analogue electronic equipment,
    networking, Design and development of computer software and hardware and
    various forms of communication engineering. Students who have analytical and
    logical reasoning skills, as well as an interest in software development,
    testing, and programming, should consider a career in this field.
    <br />
    <br />
    The scope of computer engineer is to work with software systems to nurture a
    business and meet the needs of new forms of innovation in the field of
    technology. According to the definition of computer science engineering,
    this branch of engineering also deals with designing and developing computer
    algorithms in order to achieve specific business goals. In addition,
    students who earn a degree from this institute will be prepared to work as
    designers, developers, solution integrators, network administrators,
    database administrators, domain consultants, and software engineers in some
    of the world’s most prestigious companies.
    <br />
    <br />
    The program emphasis on practical and hands-on training that strengthens the
    theoretical foundations of computer science engineering students. It is the
    job of a computer engineer/ software engineer to design and develop software
    to meet the needs of a business or individual. Today’s cutting-edge
    technologies can be traced back to CSE. These include Artificial
    Intelligence/Machine Learning/Big Data/Internet of Things/Quantum
    Computing/Block-Chain/Industry 4.0/AR & VR/Android-IOS development etc.
    <br />
    <br />
    Students at Tula’s, one of most prestigious engineering institute of the
    state , can earn their degree in four years with full-time study. Dedicated
    teaching & learning process and skill development are made possible by the
    state of the art infrastructure with ICT facilities. When it comes to study
    at Tula’s, quality is a top priority, so it gets done.
