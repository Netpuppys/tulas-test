    The Bachelor of Journalism & Mass Communication is a three-year
    interdisciplinary program designed for the modern times, where students gain
    a comprehensive understanding of media and its multifaceted nature. This
    curriculum encompasses essential theories related to media, its historical
    evolution, and its legal and ethical responsibilities in today’s digital
    age.
    <br />
    <br />
    Students learn how to craft news stories, create compelling headlines, and
    navigate the intricacies of various media platforms. They delve into media
    laws, constitutional frameworks, and other pertinent regulations essential
    for a career in journalism and public communication. Additionally, the
    program emphasizes the cultivation of creativity, offering training in
    photography, filmmaking, design, editing, and other critical components of
    visual storytelling, such as screenwriting and storyboarding.
    <br />
    <br />
    For those interested in advertising and public relations, the curriculum
    covers historical and theoretical foundations in these fields. Key subjects
    like Development Communication, Visual Communication, and Media Research
    equip students with the knowledge and skills needed to thrive in an
    ever-changing media landscape.
    <br />
    <br />
    Moreover, this program not only sharpens media-specific competencies but
    also fosters a profound understanding of media's historical context and
    comprehensive role in society.
    <br />
    <br />
    The Department enhances the learning experience by organizing outdoor
    photography excursions, educational trips, film screenings followed by
    discussions, spontaneous extemporaneous speaking events, and interactive
    sessions with industry professionals. These activities enrich students'
    social engagement and practical knowledge.
    <br />
    <br />
    Additionally, students connect with diverse communities, including media
    professionals, cultural groups, regional artists, film stars, award-winning
    athletes, and reformers, through various engagement initiatives. This
    exposure helps cultivate a well-rounded perspective on media's impact in the
    21st century.
