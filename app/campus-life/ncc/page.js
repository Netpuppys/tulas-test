          The National Cadet Corps (NCC) at Tula’s Institute plays a pivotal
          role in shaping disciplined and responsible citizens. Our NCC unit is
          dedicated to fostering qualities of leadership, patriotism, and
          selfless service among students. Through a structured program of
          physical training, drills, adventure activities, and community
          service, cadets develop a strong sense of duty and resilience.
          <br />
          <br />
          The NCC at Tula’s Institute offers students the opportunity to
          participate in various national and state-level camps, parades, and
          competitions, providing them with a platform to showcase their skills
          and dedication. These experiences not only build character but also
          establish a deep sense of national pride and civic responsibility.
          <br />
          <br />
          By being a part of the NCC, students at Tula’s Institute gain
          invaluable life skills, leadership qualities, and a commitment to
          serving the nation. The NCC program is a cornerstone of our
          institute’s commitment to holistic education and personal development.
