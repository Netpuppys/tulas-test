          In the past few years, procedures for digitizing books at high speed
          and comparatively low cost have improved considerably. The result is
          that we can now digitize millions of books per year for creating
          digital libraries.
          <br />
          <br />
          Our Digital library has over 18383+ e-books and 3338 + e-Journals
          available round the clock through a FTP server on the intranet,
          whereby students can access the material and books anytime from
          anywhere on the campus.
