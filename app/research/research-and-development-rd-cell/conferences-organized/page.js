                A conference is a gathering of multiple individuals of the
                parent and other institutes to discuss and share their views on
                a specific theme. It is easy to mix it up with conventions,
                colloquia, and symposiums. While each conference is unique in
                terms of size and purpose, the phrase can be used to the overall
                concept. The keynote address is delivered by one or more keynote
                speakers in all the conferences. The key note speakers selected
                are well-known personalities/Experts in the field, and their
                presence is intended to encourage more people to attend the
                conferences. The list of conferences organized by the institute
                is as follows:
