                At Tulaâ€™s Institute, we recognize the importance of Books, book
                chapters and conference publication as a significant aspect of
                academic learning and research. We encourage our faculty,
                researchers, and students to actively participate in conferences
                relevant to their areas of expertise and share their research
                findings with the wider academic community.
