          The R&D Cell plays a crucial role in facilitating the smooth
          conduction of various government and non-government research projects
          at Tula’s Institute. It acts as a central point of contact and support
          for researchers, ensuring that projects are executed efficiently and
          effectively.
          <br />
          <br />
          One of the key responsibilities of the R&D Cell is to assist faculty
          members in securing research grants. It actively seeks out funding
          opportunities from government agencies, foundations, and other
          organizations that support research initiatives. The cell provides
          guidance and resources to faculty members, helping them navigate the
          complex process of grant applications. By streamlining this process,
          the R&D Cell enhances the chances of obtaining research funding and
          supports the faculty in pursuing their research interests.
          <br />
          <br />
          Additionally, the R&D Cell facilitates and encourages faculty and
          student members to publish their research work in various reputed
          journals. It recognizes the importance of disseminating research
          findings and contributing to the wider scientific community. The cell
          provides guidance on identifying suitable journals, manuscript
          preparation, and submission procedures. By assisting in the
          publication process, the R&D Cell ensures that the valuable research
          conducted by faculty and students receives the recognition it
          deserves.
