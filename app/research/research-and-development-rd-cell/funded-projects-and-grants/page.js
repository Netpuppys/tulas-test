                Research projects provide opportunities for academic individuals
                to acquire and use their skills in a variety of fields. It will
                be pertinent and graceful if a project gets funded by some
                Govt./Other agency and will certainly meet all the expenditure
                to be met out during the tenure of that project. It also allows
                students to collaborate with their faculty members on research
                projects. AICTE, ISRO, DST, UCOST, SERB and other national and
                international financial bodies offer sponsored initiatives under
                various research schemes to the aspirants.

                Various projects and research grants awarded to our institute
